# Structures-for-a-large-volume-of-CDR-records.

This project was made for the University class "Systems Programming".
The task was the implementation of a set of structures which would allow the insertion, modification,
as well as queries in a large volume of Call Detail Record records.

# What I Learned

* Hash table theory and implementation 
* Managing structures for a large volume of records
* Minimizing cost of operations
